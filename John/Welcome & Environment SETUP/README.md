##Web Development Basics:
###What is web development, and why is it essential in the context of the internet?

Simply web development is the art and process of creating websites, web applications, maintaining them and making them accessible via the internet.
Web development is essential in the context of the internet for several reasons:

    *Global accessibility - This means businesses, organisations, and individuals can reach a vast audience regardless of geographical location.
    *Information Sharing and Communication - Web development facilitates the creation of websites and web applications that enable individuals and organisations to disseminate information, communicate with others, and collaborate on various projects.
    *E-commerce and Online Transactions - Websites and web applications provide platforms for conducting secure online transactions, managing inventory, processing payments, and providing customer support.
    *Career Opportunities - With web development as the backbone of the digital world, the demand for web developers remains consistently high. As the tech landscape continues to evolve, so will the skills and job opportunities in the field of web development. 

##HTML Knowledge:
###Have you heard of HTML? If yes, what does HTML stand for, and what is its primary purpose in web development?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. If we can compare a website to a human body, the HTML would be the skeleton.
Just like the skeleton, HTML gives the website:

    *Framework for Structure - It defines the basic structure and layout of content on a webpage.
    *Supports and Organises Content - supports and organises the content of a webpage. It provides the structure that holds together text, images, videos, forms, and other media elements.
    *Connects and Interacts - just as the skeleton allows for movement and interaction within the body, HTML enables interaction and navigation within a webpage.
