# GOMYCODE ASSESSMENTS

This repository is meant to hold the theory assessment exercises, and is made in order to practise collaboration on Github.

Each student has their own folders where they upload the answers to the assessment questions. Each assessment should have its own folder within the student's folder, as demonstrated in the example provided.

When making changes to the repository, follow the Github collaboration steps (creating a new branch for each chapter's assessment is especially important).

If you are new to collaboration on Github, use these resources to understand it:

As always, if there is something that you do not understand, reasearch it, and if no solution is forthcoming, you can reach out.
